# ggDESeq

Overview
--------

The aim of 'ggDESeq' is to make rapid visualizations of commonly used RNA seq plots derived from 'DESeq' data sets a possibility. By implementing the aesthetic qualities of 'ggplot2', we are able to generate publication-worthy graphics. You need to provide the DESeq-related data frame with subsequent experimental conditions, and it takes care of the graphics and condtional statements.
